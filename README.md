# WOODEN ELEMENTS ðŸ§ª

Using:
- CSV file of all the elements
- Inkscape to make the basic model **element.svg**
- Then sending it through [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)
- Add the id sym, name and number to the text attributes
- Then using main.py to compile into a huge final file called **final.svg**
- Then using [SVG to DXF](https://anyconv.com/svg-to-dxf-converter/) to convert it into a dxf file that I can import into Lightburn, the program to lasercut

We end up with:

Note: I can't seem to find the correct fonts again for the original peices :(
